# Quadrotor Control and Design
## Project Objectives
* Assemble the electromechanical system of a quadrotor.
* Program interfaces between embedded computer (Raspberry Pi running Linux) and external sensors and actuators (IMU, motor controllers).
* Program and tune a time-critical control loop for stable flight
* Create software stack that interacts with low-level code to achieve high-level behavior including:
  1. Control the quadrotor with logitech joystick.
  2. Autonomous flight with HTC vive.
